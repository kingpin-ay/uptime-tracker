# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Website/API Monitor Creation Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting website/API monitors.
# Details:
1. Create RESTful API endpoints for website monitors:
   - POST /api/monitors/website (create)
   - GET /api/monitors/website (list all)
   - GET /api/monitors/website/:id (get one)
   - PUT /api/monitors/website/:id (update)
   - DELETE /api/monitors/website/:id (delete)
2. Implement validation for monitor creation:
   - Valid URL format
   - Valid HTTP method (GET/POST)
   - Valid interval (5, 15, 30 minutes)
3. Enforce free tier limitations (max 3 monitors total)
4. Implement authorization to ensure users can only access their own monitors
5. Store monitor configuration in the database
6. Implement logic to handle request headers and authentication for API monitoring
7. Add validation for monitor updates

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for validation logic. Create integration tests for each API endpoint. Test authorization by attempting to access monitors from different users. Verify free tier limitations are enforced. Test edge cases like malformed URLs or invalid intervals.
