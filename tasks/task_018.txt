# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Implement secure HTTP headers:
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - Referrer-Policy
2. Configure HTTPS/TLS for all communications
3. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Add CSRF protection for form submissions
5. Ensure secure storage of sensitive data:
   - Encrypt API credentials at rest
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
6. Implement input validation on all endpoints
7. Create security-focused middleware
8. Add protection against common web vulnerabilities
9. Implement JWT token security best practices

# Test Strategy:
Perform security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP. Test rate limiting by exceeding thresholds. Verify CSRF protection prevents cross-site requests. Test input validation with malicious payloads. Verify encryption of sensitive data in the database.
