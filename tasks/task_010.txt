# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Alerting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the alerting system that sends notifications for monitor failures and missed cron jobs.
# Details:
1. Integrate with email service (SendGrid or AWS SES)
2. Create alert templates for:
   - Website/API down alerts
   - Missed cron job alerts
   - Resolution notifications
3. Implement alert throttling to prevent alert fatigue
   - Set minimum time between repeated alerts
   - Group multiple failures into single notifications when appropriate
4. Create alert tracking in database
5. Implement alert acknowledgment functionality
6. Add resolution detection and notification
7. Create alert history tracking
8. Implement email delivery retry logic
9. Add logging for all alert activities

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for alert generation logic. Test email template rendering. Create integration tests with mock email service. Verify throttling logic prevents excessive alerts. Test acknowledgment functionality. Verify resolution detection works correctly.
