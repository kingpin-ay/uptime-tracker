   - Monitor list with status indicators
   - Status summary showing counts of total/healthy/alerting monitors
   - Quick filters for monitor types and status
   - Search functionality for monitors
   - Add monitor button/call-to-action
2. Implement status indicators with appropriate colors:
   - Green (#10B981) for healthy/up status
   - Red (#EF4444) for down/alerting status
3. Display last check time for website monitors
4. Show last ping time for cron job monitors
5. Display uptime percentages for 24h and 7d periods
6. Implement auto-refresh functionality (every 30-60 seconds)
7. Create loading states and error handling
8. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for UI components. Test responsive design across different screen sizes. Verify auto-refresh functionality works correctly. Test search and filtering capabilities. Verify correct status display for different monitor states.
