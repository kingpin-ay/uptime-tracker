# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Cron Job Monitor Creation Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting cron job monitors.
# Details:
1. Create RESTful API endpoints for cron job monitors:
   - POST /api/monitors/cronjob (create)
   - GET /api/monitors/cronjob (list all)
   - GET /api/monitors/cronjob/:id (get one)
   - PUT /api/monitors/cronjob/:id (update)
   - DELETE /api/monitors/cronjob/:id (delete)
2. Implement validation for cron job monitor creation:
   - Valid name
   - Valid expected ping interval
3. Generate unique ping URLs for each cron job monitor
   - Format: https://domain.com/ping/{unique-identifier}
   - Use UUID v4 for unique identifiers
4. Enforce free tier limitations (max 3 monitors total)
5. Implement authorization to ensure users can only access their own monitors
6. Create endpoint for ping URL reset
7. Implement ping receiver endpoint that records successful pings

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for validation logic and unique URL generation. Create integration tests for each API endpoint. Test ping URL functionality by simulating cron job pings. Verify URL reset functionality works correctly. Test authorization by attempting to access monitors from different users.
