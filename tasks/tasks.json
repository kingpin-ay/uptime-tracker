Install Drizzle ORM and related dependencies:\n   - Add `drizzle-orm` and appropriate database driver (e.g., `@libsql/client` for SQLite, `pg` for PostgreSQL)\n   - Install `dotenv` for environment variable management\n\n2. Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following variables:\n   - DATABASE_URL: The connection string for the database\n   - DATABASE_USER: Database username (if applicable)\n   - DATABASE_PASSWORD: Database password (if applicable)\n   - DATABASE_HOST: Database host (if applicable)\n   - DATABASE_PORT: Database port (if applicable)\n   - DATABASE_NAME: Database name (if applicable)\n\n3. Create a database connection module:\n   - Implement a `db.ts` or similar file that handles the connection setup\n   - Use `dotenv` to load environment variables\n   - Configure Drizzle with the appropriate database adapter\n   - Implement connection pooling if needed\n   - Add error handling for connection failures\n\n4. Create schema definitions:\n   - Define database tables using Drizzle's schema definition syntax\n   - Include appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships\n\n5. Implement a connection management strategy:\n   - Consider connection pooling for production environments\n   - Implement proper connection closing/cleanup\n\n6. Security considerations:\n   - Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore`\n   - Implement validation for environment variables\n   - Consider encryption for sensitive connection details\n   - Add appropriate error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information\n\n7.

Environment Variable Testing:\n   - Test behavior when required environment variables are missing\n   - Test behavior with invalid connection strings\n   - Verify error messages don't expose sensitive information\n\n4. Security Testing:\n   - Verify that database credentials are not logged or exposed\n   - Ensure the application fails securely if database connection fails\n   - Check that the `.env` file is properly excluded from version control\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure connection establishment time\n   - Test connection pool behavior under load (if applicable)\n\n6. Manual Verification:\n   - Review the implementation against Drizzle ORM best practices\n   - Verify that all database operations use the Drizzle ORM interface\n   - Check that no hardcoded credentials exist in the codebase\n\n7. Documentation Review:\n   - Verify documentation includes all required environment variables\n   - Ensure setup instructions are clear and complete",
