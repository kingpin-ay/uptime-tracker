# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the authentication system supporting both email/password and GitHub OAuth login methods.
# Details:
1. Implement Passport.js for authentication strategies
2. Create local strategy for email/password authentication
   - Implement secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Store user credentials in the database
3. Implement GitHub OAuth strategy
   - Register application with GitHub
   - Configure callback URLs
   - Handle user creation/linking based on email
4. Create JWT token generation for authenticated sessions
5. Implement middleware for protected routes
6. Create registration endpoint with email verification
7. Implement password reset functionality
8. Create login/logout endpoints
9. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
10. Add CSRF protection for form submissions

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for authentication functions. Test registration, login, and password reset flows. Verify GitHub OAuth integration with mock OAuth responses. Test security measures like rate limiting and CSRF protection. Ensure password hashing is working correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up local authentication with email/password [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the local authentication strategy using email and password
### Details:
Create user model with email and password fields. Implement password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2. Create registration endpoint that validates input, checks for existing users, and stores new users securely. Implement login endpoint that verifies credentials and generates authentication tokens.

## 2. Implement GitHub OAuth integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up GitHub OAuth authentication flow
### Details:
Register application with GitHub to obtain client ID and secret. Implement OAuth endpoints for authorization and callback. Handle GitHub API responses and extract user information. Create or link GitHub users with existing accounts in the database.

## 3. Develop JWT token management system [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create a robust JWT token generation and validation system
### Details:
Implement JWT token generation with appropriate payload structure and expiration. Create refresh token mechanism for extending sessions securely. Develop token blacklisting for logout functionality. Implement secure token storage strategy on client-side.

## 4. Create authentication middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop middleware to protect routes and validate authentication
### Details:
Create middleware to verify JWT tokens on protected routes. Implement role-based access control for different user permissions. Handle token expiration and renewal within middleware. Add proper error responses for authentication failures.

## 5. Implement security features and best practices [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Add security measures to protect the authentication system
### Details:
Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Add CSRF protection for authentication endpoints. Set up secure HTTP headers (Content-Security-Policy, etc.). Implement input validation and sanitization for all authentication inputs. Configure proper CORS settings.

## 6. Develop user account management features [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create functionality for users to manage their accounts
### Details:
Implement password reset functionality with secure tokens. Create email verification system for new accounts. Develop profile update functionality with proper validation. Add account deletion capability with proper cleanup. Implement session management allowing users to view and terminate active sessions.

## 7. Create comprehensive error handling and logging [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Implement robust error handling and security logging for authentication
### Details:
Develop standardized error responses for authentication failures. Implement security event logging for login attempts, password changes, etc. Create monitoring for suspicious activities (multiple failed logins, etc.). Set up alerting for potential security breaches. Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information.
