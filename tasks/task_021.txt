# Task ID: 21
# Title: Task #21: Setup Drizzle ORM for Database Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and configure Drizzle ORM in the backend to manage database connections, with all database credentials securely loaded from environment variables.
# Details:
1. Install Drizzle ORM and related dependencies:
   - Add `drizzle-orm` and appropriate database driver (e.g., `@libsql/client` for SQLite, `pg` for PostgreSQL)
   - Install `dotenv` for environment variable management

2. Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following variables:
   - DATABASE_URL: The connection string for the database
   - DATABASE_USER: Database username (if applicable)
   - DATABASE_PASSWORD: Database password (if applicable)
   - DATABASE_HOST: Database host (if applicable)
   - DATABASE_PORT: Database port (if applicable)
   - DATABASE_NAME: Database name (if applicable)

3. Create a database connection module:
   - Implement a `db.ts` or similar file that handles the connection setup
   - Use `dotenv` to load environment variables
   - Configure Drizzle with the appropriate database adapter
   - Implement connection pooling if needed
   - Add error handling for connection failures

4. Create schema definitions:
   - Define database tables using Drizzle's schema definition syntax
   - Include appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships

5. Implement a connection management strategy:
   - Consider connection pooling for production environments
   - Implement proper connection closing/cleanup

6. Security considerations:
   - Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore`
   - Implement validation for environment variables
   - Consider encryption for sensitive connection details
   - Add appropriate error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

7. Documentation:
   - Document the database schema
   - Include setup instructions for other developers
   - Document any environment variables required

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the database connection module
   - Mock the database connection to test error handling
   - Verify environment variables are correctly loaded

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test database environment with test credentials
   - Create a test-specific `.env.test` file
   - Verify successful connection to the test database
   - Test basic CRUD operations using Drizzle ORM
   - Verify connection pooling works as expected (if implemented)

3. Environment Variable Testing:
   - Test behavior when required environment variables are missing
   - Test behavior with invalid connection strings
   - Verify error messages don't expose sensitive information

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify that database credentials are not logged or exposed
   - Ensure the application fails securely if database connection fails
   - Check that the `.env` file is properly excluded from version control

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure connection establishment time
   - Test connection pool behavior under load (if applicable)

6. Manual Verification:
   - Review the implementation against Drizzle ORM best practices
   - Verify that all database operations use the Drizzle ORM interface
   - Check that no hardcoded credentials exist in the codebase

7. Documentation Review:
   - Verify documentation includes all required environment variables
   - Ensure setup instructions are clear and complete

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Drizzle ORM dependencies and setup environment configuration [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install all necessary Drizzle ORM packages and configure environment variables for database connection
### Details:
1. Install required packages: `drizzle-orm`, appropriate database driver (e.g., `@libsql/client` for SQLite or `pg` for PostgreSQL), and `dotenv`
2. Create a `.env` file at the project root with all required database connection variables (DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD, etc.)
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information
4. Create a `.env.example` file with placeholder values as a template for other developers
5. Implement a basic environment variable validation function to ensure all required variables are present

## 2. Create database connection module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a core database connection module that handles connection setup and management
### Details:
1. Create a `db.ts` file in an appropriate location (e.g., `src/lib/db.ts`)
2. Use `dotenv` to load environment variables
3. Configure Drizzle with the appropriate database adapter based on the selected database
4. Implement connection pooling if needed for the chosen database
5. Add robust error handling for connection failures
6. Export a database client instance that can be imported by other modules
7. Implement a connection health check function

## 3. Define database schema using Drizzle [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create schema definitions for all database tables using Drizzle's schema definition syntax
### Details:
1. Create a `schema` directory to organize table definitions
2. Define each table using Drizzle's schema definition syntax with appropriate data types
3. Implement constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, etc.)
4. Define relationships between tables
5. Export the schema definitions for use in queries
6. Consider organizing schemas by domain/feature if the application has many tables

## 4. Implement database query utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create utility functions for common database operations to simplify data access throughout the application
### Details:
1. Create a `queries.ts` file or directory for query utilities
2. Implement functions for common CRUD operations
3. Add transaction support for operations that require it
4. Implement proper error handling and logging for database operations
5. Create helper functions for pagination and filtering if needed
6. Ensure all query functions use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## 5. Create documentation and connection management strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the database setup and implement proper connection management for production environments
### Details:
1. Document the database schema with diagrams and descriptions
2. Create setup instructions for other developers
3. Document all environment variables and their purpose
4. Implement proper connection closing/cleanup mechanisms
5. Add connection pooling configuration for production environments
6. Implement reconnection strategies for handling temporary connection failures
7. Create a database migration strategy if needed
8. Add monitoring and logging for database performance
