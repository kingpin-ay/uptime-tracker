## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Uptime Monitor + Cron Job Alerts system. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, providing clear specifications and acceptance criteria for the successful implementation of the product.

The Uptime Monitor + Cron Job Alerts system is designed to provide developers and system administrators with a reliable tool to monitor the availability of websites, APIs, and the successful execution of scheduled tasks (cron jobs). This PRD defines the scope, features, workflows, and technical requirements necessary to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that addresses these core monitoring needs.

This document will be used as a reference throughout the development process to ensure that all requirements are properly implemented and tested before release.

## 2. Product overview

The Uptime Monitor + Cron Job Alerts system is a comprehensive monitoring solution that helps developers and system administrators ensure their web services and scheduled tasks are running as expected. The product consists of two primary monitoring capabilities:

1. **Website/API Monitoring**: Regularly checks websites and APIs for availability by sending HTTP requests at configurable intervals and tracking response status codes and time.

2. **Cron Job Monitoring**: Provides unique URLs that can be pinged by cron jobs after successful execution, enabling users to verify that their scheduled tasks are running on time.

The system features a centralized dashboard that displays the status of all monitored services and sends email alerts when issues are detected. Users can quickly identify problems, track historical performance, and receive timely notifications when their services require attention.

Built with a focus on reliability and ease of use, the system aims to provide peace of mind to developers and administrators who need to ensure their services remain operational around the clock.

## 3. Goals and objectives

### Primary goals

1. Provide developers and system administrators with a reliable tool to monitor website/API availability and cron job execution.
2. Deliver timely alerts when monitored services fail or cron jobs miss their expected execution windows.
3. Present monitoring data in an intuitive dashboard that enables users to quickly assess the health of their services.
4. Offer a free tier that provides essential monitoring capabilities for individual developers and small projects.

### Business objectives

1. Attract a user base of at least 1,000 active users within the first three months of launch.
2. Achieve a 15% conversion rate from free to paid subscriptions within six months of launch.
